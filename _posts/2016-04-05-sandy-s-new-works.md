* A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.

Friends can help each other. A true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself - and especially to feel. Or, not feel. Whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them. That's what real love amounts to - letting a person be what he really is.

Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Eos, mollitia! Animi et dolore ab ratione cupiditate totam error ducimus, reiciendis voluptatum praesentium dignissimos vitae nostrum autem similique unde minus deleniti.
